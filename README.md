# Dualis API: WIP

## Requirements
Should be able to return all modules and it's grades for a specific user from dualis.dhbw.de.
This should work for any grade and probably store the grades in a specified data structure but due to dualis' incompetence that may be impossible.

### Email notifications
Additional any user who wants to should get an email if a grade has been updated.
